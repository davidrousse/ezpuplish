(index.php, index_treemenu.php) to be ready for eZ Publish version 5 later on

- Refactored ezpKernelResult to be able to store arbitrary attributes in it.
- Fixed missing isset() in eZDebug::updateSettings()
- Fix regression from #019544: Showing/hiding a large number of objects generates fatal error
- Ensure to deactivate debug output in content/treemenu, in case going through index.php instead of index_tree_menu.php
- Force not to use pagelayout using treemenu
- Refactored index_treemenu.php to use ezpKernel with a dedicated ezpKernelHandler instance.
- content/treemenu now using (at last) json_encode() instead of custom arrayToJSON() function
